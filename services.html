                My background includes building fraud systems, co-founding a research driven platform that was commercially acquired, and sitting inside the consequences of institutional failure. I now use that experience as an independent counterpart who is paid to tell you what others will not.

                    How I work with organisations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human Integrity Advisory exists for situations where standard consulting and internal committees are not enough. Where AI, data, culture, and public trust intersect, you do not need another deck. You need someone who understands how systems actually behave, how power and fear distort decisions, and where integrity is silently leaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I combine three strands. Years spent close to neural networks and fraud architectures. Years translating research and complexity into products and structures that could operate in the real world. And years living on the receiving end of systems that failed to see their own impact. The work sits at the point where those strands meet.
                </p>
                <p class="meta mb-0">
                    If you are looking for reassurance, brand polish, or someone to endorse decisions already made, I am not a fit. If you want clear sight and are prepared to act on it, we may work well together.

                        Every engagement begins with a written scope that defines responsibilities, communication channels, and boundaries. There is no informal support outside that structure. Additional questions, calls, or document reviews sit outside scope and are treated as new work with their own agreement. This protects the integrity of the work and everyone involved.

                                An <strong>Executive Reflection Session</strong> is often the cleanest starting point. We clarify what is at stake, where pressure is coming from, what you are afraid to name, and what integrity would look like in practice. You leave with a written view you can test your choices against.

                                The <strong>Ethics Review Sprint</strong> provides a detailed but contained examination of how your AI or decision system behaves for real people. It gives leadership, legal, and technical teams a shared, concrete picture of reality rather than a set of assumptions.

                                An <strong>Integrity Retainer</strong> offers a stable relationship where someone consistently pays attention to how decisions, systems, and human impact line up over months and years, not just when something breaks in public.
