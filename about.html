            Why this work exists
        </h2>
        <p>
            Human Integrity Advisory is the result of years spent inside technical, institutional, and human systems that did not always match the way they described themselves. I have seen how decisions are shaped by pressure, hierarchy, gaps in information, and the desire to appear certain. I have also seen how those same decisions are lived by the people who carry their consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work exists for leaders who want clarity rather than performance. I sit at the meeting point of two realities. One is the formal governance and technical structure behind decisions. The other is the lived nervous system that absorbs them. When those realities drift apart, harm accumulates quietly and out of view. Integrity is the work of bringing them back into alignment.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
            This is not abstract for me. I have lived the cost of misalignment. That is what keeps my attention steady, unflinching, and grounded in what is real.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Human integrity as lived expertise -->
    <section class="card-like" id="lived-expertise">
        <h2 class="with-icon">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse h2-icon"></i>
            Human integrity as lived expertise
        </h2>
        <p>
            Many organisations treat ethics as a policy surface. My work sits closer to the point where decisions land. I understand what it is to be downstream of institutional judgement, and that lived experience shapes my approach. It does not make the work emotional. It makes it honest. It prevents me from being captured by the performance of ethics rather than its substance.
        </p>
        <p>
            This perspective gives me a habit of listening for what is not said, what is implied, or what is quietly handed to people with less power. Integrity is often a question of attention. Where it goes. Where it does not. What is allowed to be named. What is quietly avoided.
        </p>
        <p class="meta mb-0">
            Lived experience does not replace analytical discipline. It strengthens it. It removes distortion.

            Technical and systems foundations
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before founding Human Integrity Advisory I worked across applied AI, fraud detection, and full stack development. Technical fluency is not my identity, but it is part of my foundation. It means I can interrogate assumptions, spot pressure points, and translate accurately between engineers, product teams, legal, and leadership without distortion.

            Technical fluency is not the goal. It is what keeps the conversation anchored in reality rather than organisational aspiration.

            AI, fraud systems, and explainability
        </h2>
        <p>
            Between 2014 and 2020 I worked closely with Dr, (now) Professor, Nicholas F. Ryman Tubb at the University of Surrey on neural network explainability for payment card fraud. I helped develop the structural backbone for the contextual and literature foundations of his doctoral work and designed the conceptual diagrams and frameworks used throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
            That work exposed me to the real tension points inside AI systems. Thresholds. Error trade offs. Narrative pressure. Regulatory scrutiny. Human consequence. It taught me how models behave outside controlled academic environments and how organisations respond when uncertainty becomes uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p class="meta mb-0">
            Explainability is not documentation. It is a governance requirement and a human requirement.

    <!-- FITS and FATHOM -->
    <section class="card-like" id="fits">

            FITS, FATHOM, and lessons in ownership and integrity
        </h2>
        <p>
            A significant part of my trajectory came through co founding the Institute of Financial Innovation in Transactions and Security (FITS). FITS was designed as a not for profit response to payment card fraud and the movement of money into criminal economies. It brought together academia, industry, and law enforcement, supported by the University of Surrey and European grant funding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although my title began as Chief Marketing Officer, the operational and product load moved toward me. I became the de facto Chief Operating Officer and product designer. I built the public facing ecosystem, created the technical infrastructure, produced all collateral, and translated research into something partners could actually use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary output was FATHOM, a real time fraud management platform built on Intenda and the fraXses data architecture. I designed and built the full front end interface that investigators, analysts, and executives worked inside. That meant turning complex analytics into clear structures and decision flows that non technical users could trust.

        </ul>
        <p>
            When FATHOM reached commercial value, the intellectual property was sold. The experience revealed how structures can quietly erase the people who build the foundations. It exposed a longstanding personal pattern of over giving and under receiving that I no longer allow to shape my work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
            Human Integrity Advisory is a continuation of that trajectory, but with different boundaries. It is the place where the same depth, precision, and integrative capacity are now offered with clarity, explicit recognition, and a focus on leaders who want to build systems that do not repeat the same patterns of misalignment.
