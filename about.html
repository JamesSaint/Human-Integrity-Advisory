                    Why this work exists
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human Integrity Advisory is the product of years spent inside technical, institutional, and human systems that did not always align. I have seen how decisions are made in rooms of authority, and how differently those decisions are lived by the people with the least power to influence them. Most organisations speak fluent policy and risk. Fewer have the courage or permission to be honest about pressure, ambiguity, or impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work exists for leaders who want clarity rather than performance. I operate at the convergence of two realities. One is the formal governance structure that shapes decisions. The other is the lived nervous system that carries their consequences. When these realities move apart, harm accumulates quietly. Integrity is the practice of bringing them back into alignment.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    I do this because I have lived the cost of misalignment. That perspective keeps the work grounded, steady, and unflinching.

                    Human integrity as lived expertise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of what organisations call ethics happens on paper long before it happens in behaviour. My work sits closer to the human side of that gap. I understand the technical systems, and I also understand the experience of being downstream from institutional decisions that were made without full sight of their impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This gives me a particular discipline. I listen not only to what is said, but to what is implied, omitted, or quietly left for others to absorb. It is a practical form of integrity rather than a theoretical one.
                </p>
                <p class="meta mb-0">
                    This lived foundation keeps the analysis honest and prevents the slide into institutional theatre.

                    Technical and systems foundations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My early career was built inside applied AI, fraud detection architectures, and full stack development. I am fluent enough in the technical detail to interrogate assumptions, translate across engineering and executive domains, and see where risk or distortion hides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These foundations include:

                <ul class="icon-list icon-list-services">

                        Hands on development across the web stack, which allows me to bridge design, engineering, and governance conversations without interpretation gaps.

                    AI, fraud systems, and explainability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From 2014 to 2020 I worked closely with Dr, now Professor, Nicholas F. Ryman Tubb at the University of Surrey during the development of his doctoral research into explainability for neural networks in payment card fraud. I helped build the backbone of the contextual and literature work, and designed the conceptual structures and diagrams that allowed banks, regulators, and industry partners to understand what the models were doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That work placed me inside the friction points of real AI. Threshold choices, error trade offs, narrative bias, regulatory scrutiny, and the human consequences of algorithmic decisions. It was an education in how models behave outside the lab and how organisational pressure can shape what becomes acceptable risk.
                </p>
                <p class="meta mb-0">
                    For me, explainability is not documentation. It is a governance and moral requirement.

                    FITS, FATHOM, and the point where integrity became non negotiable
                </h2>

                <p>
                    A major part of my professional trajectory came through co founding the
                    <strong>Institute of Financial Innovation in Transactions and Security (FITS)</strong>,
                    a not for profit created to reduce payment fraud and disrupt criminal economies.
                    FITS operated at the junction of academia, industry, and law enforcement, with the University of Surrey as a core partner and access to European grant funding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My role evolved from an initial CMO title into the operational centre as Chief Operating Officer. I held the practical load. Coordinating partners, translating research into structure, designing the member experience, and ensuring the work moved beyond theory and into production.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The outcome was <strong>FATHOM</strong>, a real time fraud management system built on
                    <strong>Intenda</strong> and the <strong>fraXses</strong> data platform.
                    I designed and built the entire front end interface, including dashboards, workflows, and the user experience that sat over the underlying architecture created by Intenda and our academic partners.
                </p>

                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i> Translating neural network research into usable, communicable decision structures.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    When FATHOM reached commercial viability, the structure around it shifted. At the point of sale to a corporate buyer a familiar pattern surfaced. Heavy contribution, high responsibility, and under recognition when ownership crystallised.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That moment clarified something important. It showed how quickly values can be diluted when money enters the frame, and how necessary it is to defend integrity early. It also surfaced a personal pattern of over giving and under receiving that I no longer allow to shape my work.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-0">
                    After the sale my co founder moved into a professorial role at Surrey Business School. I stepped into independent advisory work, this time with clearer boundaries, clearer governance, and a commitment to ensuring that systems do not repeat the very patterns they claim to correct.
