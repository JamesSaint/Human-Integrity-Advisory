                <h2>Professional Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    My work centres on integrity in environments where technology, strategy, regulation, and human lives meet. I advise boards, founders, and senior leaders facing decisions that have ethical, reputational, or human impact. My perspective is grounded in practical AI exposure, systems thinking, and a clear understanding of how institutional decisions land in real-world contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I provide a direct, analytical, and confidential perspective for leadership teams who want decisions they can justify publicly, privately, and ethically. My focus is always the same: clarity, coherence, and alignment between intention, system behaviour, and lived human experience.

                <h2>Early Foundations in Applied AI</h2>
                <p>
                    Between 2014 and 2020, I worked closely with Dr (now Professor) Nicholas F. Ryman-Tubb during the development of his PhD at the University of Surrey:
                    <em>Understanding Payment Card Fraud Through Knowledge Extraction from Neural Networks Using Large-Scale Datasets</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While formally credited for illustration support, my involvement provided substantial exposure to neural-symbolic reasoning, large-scale data environments, AI explainability challenges, and fraud detection systems. This period acted as a deep practical foundation that complemented my existing full-stack development expertise across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python, Java, C++, and R.

            <section class="card-like">
                <h2>Co-Founder and COO, FITS</h2>
                <p>
                    Building on that early AI work, I co-founded <strong>FITS – Financial Innovation in Transactions &amp; Security</strong>, a non-profit initiative designed to bridge applied AI research with industry to reduce global fraud. Dr Ryman-Tubb served as CEO; I held the role of COO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was responsible for establishing the full external and operational identity of the organisation, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brand identity and logo creation</li>
                    <li>Website development and digital infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Commercial brochure and marketing collateral</li>
                    <li>Email systems, hosting, and operational setup</li>
                    <li>LinkedIn and public-facing communications</li>
                    <li>Stakeholder alignment and organisational positioning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This work enabled FITS to engage credibly with financial institutions, regulators, research partners, and industry stakeholders across fraud and cyber risk.

                <h2>Current Focus</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I bring this combined technical and organisational foundation into independent advisory work. My focus is helping leadership teams reduce ethical blind spots, evaluate AI and data-driven systems, and make decisions that are strategically sound, ethically grounded, and publicly defensible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work directly with boards, founders, and executives on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrity advisory in boardroom decision environments</li>
                    <li>AI and systems ethics review with attention to human impact</li>
                    <li>Executive reflection sessions on power, responsibility, and judgement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The aim is consistent: decisions that align with reality, withstand scrutiny, and protect trust.
                </p>
