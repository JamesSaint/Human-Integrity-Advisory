                    Why this work exists
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human Integrity Advisory grew out of years spent seeing how decisions are actually made in organisations and how differently they are lived by the people who absorb their impact. Most institutions speak fluent policy and risk language. Fewer have the internal permission to speak honestly about pressure, uncertainty, or the human cost of misalignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work exists for leaders who want clarity rather than performance. I stay close to two realities at once: the technical and governance frameworks that shape decisions, and the human nervous systems that carry them. Integrity lives in the space between those two positions. When they drift apart, harm begins to accumulate out of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do this work because I have lived both sides of that drift. That experience gives me a particular discipline: I do not confuse institutional language with truth, and I do not let silence stand in for safety. My role is to reduce the gap between what an organisation says and what people experience, without drama, without performance, and without flinching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Much of what organisations call “ethics” sits at the level of policy, optics, and risk positioning. My work sits closer to where decisions land in the nervous systems, workloads, and private lives of the people who carry their consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bring lived experience of being on the receiving end of institutional failure and opaque decision making, combined with years inside technical and systems environments. That combination gives me a different kind of attention. I look for the point where a decision becomes a burden, where silence becomes pressure, and where a system quietly asks someone with less power to absorb its uncertainty.
                </p>
                <p class="meta mb-0">
                    This lived perspective does not replace analytical discipline, it prevents distortion. It keeps the work honest.

                <p>
                    Before founding Human Integrity Advisory I spent years close to applied AI, fraud detection systems, and full stack development. I am fluent enough in the technical and data realities to ask direct questions, see the implications behind design decisions, and translate accurately between engineering, legal, and executive domains.
                </p>
                <p>My foundations include:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list icon-list-services">
                    <li>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        Exposure to neural network architectures, feature engineering, model evaluation, and the operational constraints of financial fraud systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        Hands on experience across web and data stacks including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and scripting to interrogate systems and support analysis.
                    </li>

                <p class="meta mb-0">

                    AI, fraud systems, and explainability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI systems, fraud detection, and model explainability entered my professional world long before they became governance priorities. Between 2014 and 2020 I worked closely alongside Dr (now Professor) Nicholas F. Ryman Tubb during the development of his doctoral research at the University of Surrey, centred on knowledge extraction from neural networks for payment card fraud detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My input was not in the mathematical derivations but in something equally necessary: translating early conceptual sketches into diagrams, visual structures, and communicable artefacts that made the research intelligible to the different audiences around it. That work placed me inside the iterative research loop, the conversations where technical uncertainty, risk appetite, and real world implications meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Informally, those years were a sustained education in how complex models behave in practice. I saw how thresholds are chosen, where false positives and false negatives hide, how noise becomes narrative, and how decisions made in a technical context become decisions made about people. I saw how commercial pressures, regulatory expectations, and statistical ambiguity compete for influence in the same room.
                </p>
                <p class="meta mb-0">
                    The result is a perspective that treats explainability not as documentation but as a moral and governance requirement. Systems that cannot be explained cannot be trusted. Systems that cannot be trusted shift uncertainty onto the people with the least power.

                <p>
                    Building on that early AI work, I co founded <strong>Financial Innovation in Transactions and Security (FITS)</strong>, a not for profit initiative created to bridge applied research with industry in order to reduce fraud. Professor Ryman Tubb served as CEO. I served as COO.
                </p>
                <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list icon-list-services">

                        Establishing the organisation’s public identity, brand, web presence, and the clarity of its message to banks, regulators, and research partners.

                    <li>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        Producing collateral that could translate between technical research, commercial pressure, and regulatory expectation without distortion.

                    <li>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    FITS confirmed two truths for me. First, that serious thinking about integrity is desperately needed where money and technology meet. Second, that it often requires independence from institutional incentive structures to remain honest.
