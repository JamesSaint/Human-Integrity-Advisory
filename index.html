                <h2 class="with-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-compass h2-icon"></i>Why organisations work with me</h2>
                <p>
                    Most organisations have values on the wall and a risk register on the server. Fewer have a clear view of what really happens in the room when money, power, technology, and human lives meet under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work with boards and senior leadership teams who want clarity, not theatre. My focus is human integrity in practice: how decisions are made and justified, how AI and data systems are designed and deployed, and how all of this lands in the nervous systems and daily lives of real people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background sits at the intersection of systems thinking, explainable AI, and lived experience of both institutional harm and repair. I am not a brand story on a slide. I am an independent mind in the room who will name what your people and your customers will feel but may never say.
                </p>

                    A confidential, unvarnished perspective in the room when decisions matter.

                <p>
                    Many AI ethics programmes sit at the level of policy. My work begins with the human experience of the system. I examine how your models, workflows, and decision rules feel to the person with the least power in contact with them, then map the points where harm is most likely to accumulate. The output is a clear, actionable set of recommendations for leadership, legal, and technical teams.

                    My work is grounded, confidential, and deliberately free from performance. I am not a trainer or a keynote speaker. I am a long view ally whose only stake is the integrity of the work and the lives it touches.

                <p>
                    My work sits where complex systems meet human nervous systems. My perspective is informed by practical exposure to applied AI and fraud systems, full-stack technical foundations, and direct experience of how institutional decisions affect real people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bring a dual fluency: the structured, analytical language that boards and regulators require, and the grounded language of lived experience. My role is to keep those two from drifting apart.

                <p>
                    If you are considering working together, the first step is a short, structured conversation to establish context, scope,
                    and whether the work is a fit. This is not an advisory session. It is a contained discussion to ensure clarity on the
                    problem you are holding and the format that would support it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please include your role, the situation prompting the enquiry, and any relevant timelines. I do not respond to requests
                    for informal guidance, speculative questions, or unscoped support.
